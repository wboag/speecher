First experience building a web app that lets you upload a file (image/gif) and then displays it.

Most of this was very straightforward, the only challenge I ran into was that I needed to save the files in the static/ folder in order to be able to display them in the HTML. Storing in an unexposed folder led to "Unable to load" issues.
